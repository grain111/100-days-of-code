# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I have created models for menu and made migrations.

**Thoughts:** I had trubles with making migrations and m2m fields with "through" argument in django. I need to practise more sql in django.

**Link to work:** [Piiza ordering app](https://github.com/grain111/Learn_CS/tree/project3/Web%20Development/project3)
