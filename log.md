# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I have created models for the menu and made migrations.

**Thoughts:** I had troubles with making migrations and m2m fields with "through" argument in django. I need to practise more sql in django.

### Day 1: May 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I have added inline elements to my admin form view and inserted some of the menu items debuging along the way.

**Thoughts:** I now how to add items manually to my database, but I should learn using django shell to be able to do it faster.
